Using HTML5 audio feature creates a sequence of hyperlinks to play Cannon in C.

The midi version is Cannon in D, and using the amazing (MIDI.js)[https://github.com/mudcube/MIDI.js] .

Hightlight:
* use mp3splt to split mp3 into mutilple files
* a bash command to rename files into sequence order
* read midi base64 format and play

Todo:
* ~~use midi instead of mp3 if possible~~
* split audio file by notes not time interval
* ~~create a project page for this~~
