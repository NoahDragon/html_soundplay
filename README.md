HTML5 Audio Play
--------------------

Using HTML5 audio feature creates a sequence of hyperlinks to play Cannon in C.

Hightlight:
* use mp3splt to split mp3 into mutilple files
* a bash command to rename files into sequence order

Todo:
* use midi instead of mp3 if possible
* split audio file by notes not time interval
* create a project page for this
